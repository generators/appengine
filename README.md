# generator-appengine [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/generators/appengine.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/generators/appengine) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/generators/appengine.png)](https://david-dm.org/generators/appengine) 

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).


## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-appengine from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-appengine
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo appengine
```

## What's included?

 * A basic `app.yaml`
 * A blank `index.yaml`
 * A favicon
 * A robots.txt file
 * Handlers for the robots and favicon files
